# Drupal RAG Integration Module

This Drupal module integrates with the FastAPI RAG server, providing a form where users can submit questions directly from the Drupal admin toolbar and see responses generated by the system.

It also trains the chatbot with Drupal database and continue to do so with every update to Drupal system.

## Features

- Provides an `/ask-question` route where users can access the question form.

## Installation

1. Place the `drupal_rag_integration` directory into your Drupal installation under the `modules/custom` directory.
2. Navigate to the Extend page in the Drupal admin UI and enable the RAG Integration module.
3. Clear the cache so that the system recognizes the new routes and services.

## Configuration

Before using, ensure the FastAPI server is running and accessible from the Drupal site. You may need to adjust the API endpoint in the module's code to match your FastAPI server's URL.

## Usage

Once installed, click on the "Ask RAG" link in the Drupal admin toolbar to access the form. Users with the `access content` permission will be able to use the RAG system to ask questions and see generated responses.

## Updates

The module is in work in progress. In future will be added with more updates.
